                <p>This is one of the conclusions of the first detailed re-evaluation of the relationships between dinosaurs for 130 years.</p>
                <p>It shows that the current theory of how dinosaurs evolved and where they came from may well be wrong.</p>
                <p>This major shake-up of dinosaur theory is published in this weeks's edition of the <span class="boldstyle">journal Nature</span>.</p>
                <p>The reassessment shows that the meat eating beasts, such as Tyrannosaurus rex and Velociraptor, have been wrongly classified in the dinosaur family tree.</p>
                <p>One of the implications is that dinosaurs first emerged 15 million years earlier than previously believed.</p>
                <p>And the fossil evidence suggests that this origin may have occurred further north than current thinking suggests - possibly in an area that is now the UK, according to the new study's lead author, Matthew Baron of Cambridge University.</p>
                <p>"The northern continents certainly played a much bigger role in dinosaur evolution than we previously thought and dinosaurs may have originated in the UK," he told BBC News.</p>
